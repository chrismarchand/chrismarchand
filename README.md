Hello, My name is Chris 👋

Product manager for the last 5 years in brand strategy and adertising projects, I am adding a new scope at my project builder profile. A more Techy one : the web development. 🚀

I'm trained in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails thanks to Le Wagon Bordeaux. I implemented and shipped to production a clone of AirBnB and a Rails prototype with best buddies in the www :
